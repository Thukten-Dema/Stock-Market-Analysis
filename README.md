### üìà Stock Market Analysis using Big Data

This project explores how Big Data technologies can enhance stock market analysis by enabling efficient processing, predictive modeling, and real-time sentiment analysis. The system focuses on historical (batch) stock data, integrating machine learning with Big Data frameworks like Hadoop and Apache Spark to uncover market patterns, predict stock prices, and visualize insights for better investment decisions.

#### üéØ Objectives
- Identify patterns and trends in historical stock prices and trading volumes.
- Predict future stock movements using ML models like Random Forest.
- Analyze market sentiment from financial news and social media (e.g., Twitter, Reddit).
- Visualize insights through dashboards built with Streamlit.

#### üîç Features
- Volume spike detection using Hadoop MapReduce.
- Close price prediction using PySpark‚Äôs Random Forest Regressor.
- Real-time and batch sentiment analysis via NLP techniques.
- Dockerized Hadoop environment for easy deployment.
- Streamlit interface for intuitive data visualization.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- **Big Data Frameworks:** Hadoop (HDFS, MapReduce), Apache Spark, PySpark  
- **Programming Languages:** Python, Java (for MapReduce jobs)  
- **Data Processing Tools:** Docker Compose, VectorAssembler, StandardScaler  
- **ML Libraries:** PySpark MLlib, Random Forest Regressor, CrossValidator  
- **Visualization:** Streamlit, Plotly  
- **Deployment Tools:** Docker, GitLab  
- **Data Sources:** Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, Twitter, Reddit, Bloomberg, Reuters

#### üß† Learning Outcomes
